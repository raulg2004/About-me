## About Me

👋 Hi, I’m @YourUsername

💻 I'm passionate about software development, with a focus on system programming, game development, and embedded systems. I love creating efficient, low-level applications that interact closely with hardware.

🔍 Currently, I'm diving deep into advanced C/C++ programming techniques and exploring various game development frameworks. I'm also developing a banking and casino system project to improve my skills in file handling and user management in C.

🌟 I'm excited to collaborate on open-source system programming projects, game development ventures, or any software engineering projects where I can apply my skills and learn from experienced developers.

📬 How to reach me: You can reach me via email at your.email@example.com
