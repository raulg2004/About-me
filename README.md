## About Me

👋 Hi, I’m raulg2004

💻 I'm passionate about software development and cybersecurity, with a focus on system programming, game development, and embedded systems.

🔍 Currently, I'm diving deep into advanced C/C++ programming techniques and exploring various game development frameworks. I also developed a banking and casino system project and an image converter with an mp3 to improve my skills in file handling and user management in C/C++.

🌟 I'm excited to collaborate on open-source system programming projects, game development ventures, or any software engineering projects where I can apply my skills and learn from experienced developers.
